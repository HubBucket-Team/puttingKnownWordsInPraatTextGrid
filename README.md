# puttingKnownWordsInPraatTextGrid
This Python script takes a Praat text grid that's had its silences marked and the list of words (in this case from the stimuli presented to the subject) and puts the words where they should go in the text grid. (Audio file is not included.) The textgrid can then be force-aligned at the phone level using, for example, the Penn Phonetics Lab Forced Aligner.
